   - Open HACS in Home Assistant
   - Click the 3 dots in the top right
   - Select "Custom repositories"
   - Add URL: `https://github.com/Phil-Barker/hass-bosch-ebike`
   - Category: `Integration`
   - Click "Add"

2. **Install Integration:**
   - Search for "Bosch eBike Flow" in HACS
   - Click "Download"
   - Restart Home Assistant

3. **Configure:**
   - Go to Settings → Devices & Services
   - Click "+ ADD INTEGRATION"
   - Search for "Bosch eBike Flow"
   - Follow the OAuth login flow with your Bosch eBike Flow credentials

### Manual Installation

1. Copy the `custom_components/bosch_ebike` folder to your Home Assistant's `custom_components` directory
2. Restart Home Assistant
3. Add the integration via Settings → Devices & Services

## Configuration

### OAuth Setup

⚠️ **IMPORTANT:** You **MUST** use a desktop/laptop browser (not a phone/tablet) for initial setup.

The integration uses OAuth2 for secure authentication:

1. Click "Add Integration" and select "Bosch eBike Flow"
2. **Copy the authorization URL** (don't click it directly)
3. **Paste it in a new browser tab** on your computer
4. Log in with your **Bosch eBike Flow** app credentials
5. Use browser Developer Tools (F12) to extract the authorization code
6. Paste the code back into Home Assistant
7. Select which bike to monitor (if you have multiple)

**📖 [Detailed Step-by-Step Authentication Guide](AUTHENTICATION_GUIDE.md)** - Includes screenshots and troubleshooting!

### Multiple Bikes

If you have multiple eBikes registered in the Bosch eBike Flow app:

- Add the integration once for each bike
- Each bike will appear as a separate device in Home Assistant

## Understanding Sensor Updates

### Update Behavior

The ConnectModule updates the Bosch Cloud API when:

- ✅ Bike is **charging** (plugged in)
- ✅ Bike is **powered on**
- ✅ **Alarm is triggered** by motion

When the bike is unplugged, powered off, and stationary, the ConnectModule goes into low-power mode and stops sending updates.

### What This Means

- 📊 **While charging:** Sensors update every 5 minutes with current data
- 🔋 **Perfect for:** Monitoring charge sessions and creating smart charging automations
- ⚠️ **Limited when:** Bike is stored unplugged and powered off

For detailed sensor reliability information, see [SENSOR_RELIABILITY.md](SENSOR_RELIABILITY.md).

## Example Automations

### Smart Charging: Stop at 80%

Preserve battery health by stopping the charge at 80%:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "eBike: Stop charging at 80%"
    description: "Turn off smart plug when bike reaches 80% to preserve battery"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.your_bike_battery_level
      above: 80
    condition:
      - condition: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.your_bike_battery_charging
      state: "on"
    action:
      - service: switch.turn_off
        target:
          entity_id: switch.bike_charger_plug
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "🔋 eBike Charging Paused"
          message: "Battery at {{ states('sensor.your_bike_battery_level') }}% - charging stopped to preserve battery health"
```

### Notification: Charging Complete

Get notified when your bike is fully charged:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "eBike: Notify when fully charged"
    trigger:
      - platform: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.your_bike_battery_level
        above: 99
      - platform: state
        entity_id: binary_sensor.your_bike_battery_charging
        to: "off"
        for:
          minutes: 1
    condition:
      - condition: numeric_state
        entity_id: sensor.your_bike_battery_level
        above: 95
    action:
      - service: notify.mobile_app
        data:
          title: "🚴‍♂️ eBike Ready!"
          message: "Your bike is {{ states('sensor.your_bike_battery_level') }}% charged and ready to ride!"
```

### Dashboard Card Example

```yaml
type: entities
title: eBike Status
entities:
  - entity: sensor.your_bike_battery_level
    name: Battery Level
  - entity: sensor.your_bike_battery_remaining_energy
    name: Energy Remaining
  - entity: binary_sensor.your_bike_battery_charging
    name: Charging
  - entity: sensor.your_bike_total_distance
    name: Total Distance
  - entity: sensor.your_bike_charge_cycles
    name: Charge Cycles
```

## Troubleshooting

### Integration Won't Load

1. Check Home Assistant logs for errors
2. Ensure you're running HA 2024.1.0 or newer
3. Try restarting Home Assistant after installation

### OAuth Login Fails

1. Make sure you're using your **Bosch eBike Flow app** credentials
2. Check that your bike is registered in the Bosch eBike Flow app
3. Ensure your ConnectModule is paired and online

### Sensors Show "Unavailable"

1. Check that your bike's ConnectModule is paired with the Flow app
2. Power on your bike or plug it in to trigger an update
3. Wait up to 5 minutes for the next polling cycle

### Data Not Updating

The ConnectModule only sends updates when:

- Bike is charging
- Bike is powered on
- Alarm is triggered

This is normal behavior. The sensors will update once you power on or plug in your bike.

## Advanced

### Enable Diagnostic Sensors

Additional sensors are disabled by default but can be enabled:

1. Go to Settings → Devices & Services
2. Find your eBike device
3. Click the device
4. Enable desired sensors (software versions, serial numbers, etc.)

### Logging

Enable debug logging in `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: warning
  logs:
    custom_components.bosch_ebike: debug
```
